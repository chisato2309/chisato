“LycoReco” is a café with a traditional Japanese twist located in downtown Tokyo. But the delicious coffee and sugary sweets are not the only orders this café takes! From delivering packages short distances, to pick-ups and drop-offs on the lonely streets at night, to zombies and giant monster extermination…?! Whatever your problem, we're here to help! We will solve any kind of "trouble" you may have!

<!-- summary -->

Waiting for you are the ever-smiling poster-girl and the cool, serious newcomer. A petite girl who never wants to work and a young woman approaching thirty who wants to get married. And the manager is a nice guy who’s obsessed with Japan!

Whatever your order is, leave it all up to us♪
